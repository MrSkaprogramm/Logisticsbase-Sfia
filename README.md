The project simulates the operation of a logistics base. The entity truck is sent by a layer of services to the
logistics base, drives into a free terminal, leaves the terminal.
At the end of the simulation, you receive a report on the work done by the database.
The terminal can:
- Unload or load a truck with goods depending on the truck
- Recognize which type of product to work with depending on the truck
The logistics base allows the arrival of a limited number of trucks and effectively
distributes the flow of cars to free terminals
